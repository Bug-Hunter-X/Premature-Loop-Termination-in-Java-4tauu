This repository demonstrates a common error in Java programming: premature loop termination. The `BuggyLoop.java` file contains code with a `return` statement inside a loop's conditional, causing the loop to stop prematurely. The `FixedLoop.java` file provides a corrected version of the code.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering the implications of `return` statements within loops and conditional structures.
